"""
**Arithmetic Practice:**
   Write a Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers. Define the two numbers as variables within the code and print the results for each operation.
"""

first_number = 20
second_number = 15
print("ARITHMETIC OPERATIONS")
print("---------------------")
print(f"First-Number >> {first_number}\nSecond-Number >> {second_number}")
print(f"Addition of two number is >> {first_number + second_number}")
print(f"Substraction  of two number is >> {first_number - second_number}")
print(f"Multiplication of two number is >> {first_number * second_number}")
print(f"Division  of two number is >> {first_number / second_number}")
